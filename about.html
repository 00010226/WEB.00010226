 <h2>3. Why us?</h2>
 There are many different courses and schools in Tashkent👀And it’s hard to choose courses and teachers for yourself🧐 Because you choose not only by knowledge and experience, but what kind of person he is also important.  I don’t feel like irritating.  You go after all to those who love their work, burn them with humor!  It’s fun to have classes with such a teacher.  Our teachers are all distinguished by kindness and patience.  Our English courses can quickly teach you the language in a short time, and immediately see the results.

 <h2>5. Why "Home school"?</h2>
 It all started with home schooling.  This is the whole story🙈😂
 2-3 groups came to my house, and at the same time I taught students! 😂 I was in great demand!  😄All the groups were waiting for their turn🙈 But I was most interested in it, and I did not spare my strength.  When I looked at other courses, I was always interested, but are students happy to study?   Then I decided to develop my training scheme, and the name reminded me of where we started 😅 That's the name "Home school" ☺
 Recruitment to the group is already underway!

 <h2>7. What is your goal?</h2>
 To make the training useful for you, I always ask students: what is your goal? 👀 Why and why do you study English?  If you don’t know the final goal, the study will not bring tangible results
 ⚡ What goals can be:
 ✅Go to university (you can also abroad);
 ✅Get a good job in the future;
 ✅ Be a polyglot;
 ✅Free to communicate with foreigners;
 ✅ Annoy enemies 😜
